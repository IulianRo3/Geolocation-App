Geolocation Map is one of the first applications I made in Android Studio when I was just learning Java and AndroidSDK. 
The application is not created by me alone. My friend Devix71(GitHub) helped me with it.
It's far from finished. Unfortunately things are going slowly because of the extremely limited time.
Eventually I would like to launch it as a new social media app.   
So far it has implemented:   
-GoogleMaps map   
-A database with different cafes in 2 cities   
-An add to favorites function   
-Real time location   
-Function to zoom on your location   
-Search button in the application database
